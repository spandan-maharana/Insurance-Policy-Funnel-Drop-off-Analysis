## 🛡️ Impact Delivered:
This dashboard uncovered critical leakage points in the insurance policy purchase funnel, particularly during the transition from **Viewing Premium Options** to **Starting Application**, and from **Application Started** to **Document Upload**, where more than **35–40% of users** dropped off at each step.  
Device segmentation revealed that **Mobile users** experienced slightly higher abandonment rates, indicating potential for UI/UX improvements on mobile forms and document upload flows.  
Channel analysis showed that **Organic and Referral** users converted better than **Paid Ads** users, highlighting opportunities to optimize ad targeting and messaging strategies.  
By addressing these friction points, SafeShield Insurance could realistically drive a **5–7% increase** in overall policy conversion, improving customer acquisition rates while reducing marketing inefficiencies.
